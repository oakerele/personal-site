My personal site where I show my experience and skillset. It was made in AngularJS instead of a standard HTML page
so that I could learn AngularJS. There's a little backend that is deployed on heroku for contact form sending and more
stuff in the future.

One thing to remember about Angular 1 is that it may use a different compiler like gulp or grunt. You'll have
to install that like so `npm install gulp-cli -g`. You may also need SCSS if you don't already have that.
