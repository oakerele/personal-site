My personal site where I show my experience and skillset.
It was made using vanilla HTML and CSS. There's a little backend that
is deployed on Google cloud functions for contact form sending and more
stuff in the future.

You'll have to install Gulp to compile and compress the frontend.
It can be done using `npm install gulp-cli -g`.
You may also need SCSS modules if you don't already have that.
